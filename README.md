# Open-Source Uber Simulation

## Project Vision
This project aims to create an open-source, customizable Uber-like ride-hailing simulation platform. Our goal is to provide a tool for researchers, students, and industry professionals to experiment with ride-hailing algorithms, analyze system behavior, and innovate in the field of urban mobility.

## Projects: 
- **[Uber Ride API](https://github.com/parthasarathydNU/uber-ride-api)**: This project is an API for simulating an Uber-like ride-hailing service. It provides endpoints for managing various aspects of the system, including locations, drivers, passengers, and rides.

- **[Uber Frontend App](https://github.com/aadhityaalagappan/uber-frontend)** This project is the frontend mobile application which serves as the platform to book rides.

## Key Features
- Simulated environment with customizable parameters
- Rider interface for requesting rides
- Driver simulation with customizable behaviors
- Flexible matching algorithms
- Real-time visualization of system state
- Data collection and analysis tools
- API for integrating custom algorithms and models

## Current Focus
We're building the system incrementally, starting with core functionalities and gradually adding complexity. Check our [Wiki](https://github.com/parthasarathydNU/uber/wiki) for details on the current sprint and project status.

## How to Contribute
We welcome contributions from developers, researchers, and enthusiasts! Here's how you can get involved:
